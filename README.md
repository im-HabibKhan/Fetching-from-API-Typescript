# Fetching-from-API-Typescript
## Create a web application that fetches data from a public API and displays it in a table using TypeScript
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sequence wise objective
1. First, you need to choose a public API to fetch data from. There are many
public APIs available that provide different types of data such as weather,
news, sports, and more. Choose an API that provides data in a tabular
format.
2. Next, create a TypeScript file, say index.ts, in which you will write the code
to fetch data from the API and display it in a table.
3. Use the XMLHttpRequest object to fetch data from the API. You can also
use the fetch API, which is available in modern browsers. Make sure to
handle any errors that may occur during the fetch process.
4. Once you have retrieved the data, parse it into a JavaScript object. You can
use JSON.parse() to parse JSON data.
5. Create an HTML table dynamically using the data you retrieved. You can
create a table element and dynamically add tr and td elements to it using
JavaScript.
6. Finally, append the table to the DOM so that it is visible on the webpage.
